{{!--The template contains an {{input}} helper that renders as a text field, in which the user can type a pattern to filter the list of cities used in a search. --}}
{{!-- The value property of the input will be kept in sync with the value property in the component. --}}
{{!-- The key-up property will be bound to the handleFilterEntry action. The handleFilterEntry action will apply the search term filter to the list of rentals, and set a component attribute called results. --}}

{{input 
	id="cityFilter"
	value=this.city
	key-up=(action "handleFilterByCity")
	class="light"
	placeholder="Filter By City"
}}

{{input 
	id="nameFilter"
	value=this.title
	key-up=(action "handleFilterByTitle")
	bubbles=false
	class="light"
	placeholder="Filter By Title"
}}

{{!--log 'Title is ' this.title--}}

{{!-- The results are passed to the {{yield}} helper in the template. In the yielded block component, those same results are referred to as |filteredResults|. --}}
